# ===Overview===

The app is designed to give users a place to make traveling with large groups much easier! Once the user make their profile, users can create "families" consisting of other users. The admin for the family can create a vacation which consists of several pieces. Users can add themselves to the family as "attendees" to the vacation. The admin can create a destination if predetermined or several destinations that the attendees can vote. Once a destination has been selected, attendees can input all their flight and hotel information. Attendees can also add comments to the vacation, add activities to do at the destination, and update/remove themselves from the vacation.


# Development

The inspiration began as one contributor was planning a multi-family vacation but not able to find any tools to help plan. The idea came from a need to aggregate many different travel plans to smooth out the process. The team began by brainstorming the schema to develop the database and various entities that would be needed. Once the schema was finalized, the team began developing user stories based on how the app should function. The user stories were developed with needs that travelers would find useful when planning large scale vacations with several attendees. Work then began in SpringToolSuite to code the entities from the schema. Once all the entities were developed and the J-Unit tests were passed, development of controllers and DAOs began. A corresponding JSP was built with each DAO and controller for testing purposes. After the completion of all the controllers and DAOs, the team then finalized front-end development and fixed any bugs found along the way. Most of the project was done utilizing pair programming, with exceptions for individual work on front-end development.
