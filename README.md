# ===Overview===

The app is designed to give users a place to make traveling with large groups much easier! Once the user make their profile, users can create "families" consisting of other users. The admin for the family can create a vacation which consists of several pieces. Users can add themselves to the family as "attendees" to the vacation. The admin can create a destination if predetermined or several destinations that the attendees can vote. Once a destination has been selected, attendees can input all their flight and hotel information. Attendees can also add comments to the vacation, add activities to do at the destination, and update/remove themselves from the vacation.
